## Note-Taking Style Guide
To keep the vault consistent, please try to follow these simple guidelines when adding or editing notes:
1. **Use Markdown:** All notes should be written in Markdown.
2. **Link Generously:** One of the key features of Obsidian is linking. If you mention a concept that has its own note, please link to it using the [[Note Title]] syntax.
3. **Keep it Clear and Concise:** Write in a way that is easy to understand.
4. **Embed Media:** If you add images or other media, please place them in the .media folder and embed them in your notes.
