| 1.  | You are an analyst for a shopping mall with multiple stores from different brands accommodate in the mall. Sketch a single-page dashboard design on paper that includes five distinct data visualizations. Ensure each visualization is clearly labeled with axes and legends. Explain the overall purpose of the dashboard and describe how each of the five visualizations contributes to achieving this purpose in a few lines.                                                                                     |
| 2.  | A workshop is being organized for a group of twenty attendees, and the results of the workshop need to be assessed using quantitative methods. A test was administered to the attendees both prior to and following the completion of the workshop. Select a suitable visualization to represent this data and provide a rationale for your choice. How will you statistically analyze the data, and what steps will you take to determine if the workshop had a measurable effect on the participants' understanding? |
| 3.  | A survey has to be created for evaluating the feedback for a product in the market/consumers. Decide the five main questions that can be asked and the type of data in which the answers will be stored. Further which will be the five most informative data visualizations (of at least two variables) and explain whether the visualizations are for paired data analysis or unpaired.                                                                                                                              |
