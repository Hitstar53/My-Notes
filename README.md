# My-Notes
This repository is a cloud backup of an Obsidian vault, containing notes on various topics. Here's a brief overview of the folders and how to view the notes:

### Folders Structure:
- **.media**: This folder contains all the images, and other media files that are embedded in the notes.
- **Placement Preparation**: This folder contains notes related to preparing for job placements, which includes things like technical cheatsheets, interview questions, and company-specific information.
- **SPIT**: This folder contains notes related to the 7th semester at SPIT (Sardar Patel Institute of Technology), which would contain course notes, assignments, and other academic materials.
- **Upskilling**: This folder contains notes on various topics for self-improvement and learning new skills. This is actively being updated as new skills are learnt by me. It includes skill-related notes, roadmaps for learning and other materials like books.

### How to View the Notes
To view the notes in this repository, you can follow these steps:
1. **Download Obsidian**: If you don't have it already, download and install Obsidian from the official website: [https://obsidian.md/](https://obsidian.md/)
2. **Clone the Repository**: You can clone this repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
