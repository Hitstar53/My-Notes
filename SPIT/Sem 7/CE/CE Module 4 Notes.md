### Module 4: Audio & Home Technologies

#### Module 4.1: Introduction to Audio Systems & Major Components
An audio system consists of devices or equipment that capture, process, amplify, and reproduce sound. Audio systems are used in various applications such as entertainment, communication, and public address systems.

##### Characteristics of Sound Signals
Sound signals are waves that propagate through a medium and are characterized by amplitude, frequency, pitch, and fidelity.

**1. Amplitude and Loudness**:
- Amplitude determines the volume of the sound; larger amplitude results in louder sounds.
- The vibration of a source sets the amplitude of a wave. It transmits energy into the medium through its vibration.
- More energetic vibration corresponds to larger amplitude. The molecules move back and forth more vigorously.
- The loudness is a sensation of how strong a sound wave is at a place. It is always a relative term and is a dimensionless quantity
- **Measurement**: Loudness is measured in decibels (**dB**) and depends on both amplitude and human ear sensitivity: $L = log(I)$, here $I$ is the intensity.

**2. Pitch**:
- **Pitch** is a characteristic of sound by which a correct note can be distinguished from a grave or a flat note. Pitch depends upon the frequencies of the sound wave. A note has a higher pitch when the frequency is high and a note of low frequency has a low pitch.

**3. Fidelity and Frequency Response**:
- **Fidelity**: Ability of an audio system to reproduce sound faithfully without distortion i.e. amplify all of them equally.
- Fidelity is the quality of faithfulness or loyalty. Therefore the fidelity is dependent on the frequency response of the AF amplifier.
- High fidelity (Hi-Fi) is essential in order reproduce a good quality music faithfully i.e. without introducing any distortion.
- **Frequency Response**: The range of frequencies an audio system can handle, typically **20 Hz to 20,000 Hz** for human hearing.
    - **Flat response** ensures consistent sound quality across all frequencies.
- In an audio system, it may be used to minimize audible distortion by designing components (such as microphones, amplifiers and loudspeakers) so that the overall response is as flat (uniform) as possible across the system's bandwidth.

##### Sensitivity and Selectivity of the Human Ear
**Sensitivity**:
- Refers to the ear's ability to detect weakest (Low Intensity) sounds.
- **Range**: As low as 0.1 pW/m² (or 10 dB below threshold of hearing)
- Ear is Most sensitive between **3 kHz and 4 kHz**.
- Sensitivity of ear for higher frequency decreases with age, it decreases as the sound frequency goes below 500 Hz irrespective of the age.

**Selectivity**:
- Selectivity is defined as the ability of human ear to select sound signals of particular frequencies over those of some other frequencies of same intensity
- Ability to distinguish between sounds of different frequencies.
- More selective at higher frequencies than lower frequencies.


##### Microphones
A microphone is a transducer that converts sound waves into electrical signals. Microphones are used in many applications such as telephones, hearing aids, public address systems for concert halls and public events, motion picture production, live and recorded audio engineering, sound recording, two-way radios, megaphones, and radio and television broadcasting.
##### Requirements of a good microphone
A good practical microphone is expected to meet the following requirements:
1. It must have a high sensitivity
2. Flat frequency response over the desired frequency range
3. An output impedance which matches with the input impedance of an amplifier
4. Directional response as per the need of the application it is being used for
5. Signal to noise ratio be as high as possible
6. Distortion be as low as possible

1. **Carbon Microphones**:
    - Uses carbon granules that change resistance based on sound pressure.
    - Applications: Telephones, portable radios.
    - Advantages: Carbon microphones are rugged, less expensive and have high sensitivity.
    - Demerits: Distortion is rather high and is prone to heat and moisture.
2. **Dynamic Microphones**:
    - Uses electromagnetic induction via a diaphragm and coil.
    - Applications: Stage performances, broadcasting.
3. **Condenser Microphones**:
    - Uses a capacitor whose capacitance changes with sound pressure.
    - Applications: Studio recording.
4. **Ribbon Microphones**:
    - Thin metallic ribbon suspended in a magnetic field generates voltage when vibrated.
    - Applications: High-quality sound recording.


##### Loudspeakers
Loudspeakers convert electrical audio signals into sound waves.

1. Directivity 
2. Signal to noise ratio 
3. Efficiency 
4. Frequency response 
5. Distortion 
6. Speaker coil impedance 
7. Power handling capacity
##### Types:
1. **Cone Type**: Uses a moving coil attached to a conical diaphragm.
2. **Electrodynamic**: Replaces the permanent magnet with an electromagnet for higher power.
3. **Horn Type**:
    - Amplifies sound using an acoustic horn.
    - Efficiency: 30–50%.
##### Key Characteristics
- **Directivity**: Ratio of sound intensity in a given direction to that of an omnidirectional source.
- **Frequency Response**: Ideally flat across the audio range (20 Hz–20 kHz).
- **Efficiency**: Ratio of sound power output to electrical power input.

##### Public Address (PA) Systems
##### Working:
- **Microphone**: Captures sound and converts it into electrical signals.
- **Mixer**: Combines multiple input signals and isolates channels.
- **Amplifiers**: Boost the electrical signal to drive the loudspeakers.
- **Loudspeakers**: Convert amplified electrical signals back into sound.
##### Applications:
- Large gatherings, public speeches, concerts.


##### Digital Audio
Digital audio refers to sound signals converted into binary data for processing, storage, and transmission.
##### Conversion Process:
1. **Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC)**:
    - Sampling sound waves at a specific rate (e.g., **44.1 kHz** for CDs).
    - Quantization to encode sample values into binary.
2. **Digital to Analog Conversion (DAC)**:
    - Converts digital signals back into analog form for playback.
##### Advantages of Digital Audio
1. **High Quality**: Maintains fidelity during copying.
2. **Noise Resistant**: Less susceptible to distortion.
