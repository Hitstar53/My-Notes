## 1. OSI Security Architecture
### Security Attack: 
Any action that compromises the security of information owned by an organization.
Types of security attacks (passive attack):
1. Release of Message Contents: Sensitive / Conversations
2. Traffic Analysis: Usage patterns of the user

Types of security attacks (active attacks):
1. Masquerade Attack: pretends to be someone else
2. Replay Attack: capture of data units and subsequent re-transmission.
3. Message Modification Attack
4. Denial of Service Attack

### Security Mechanism: 
A process that is designed to detect, prevent or recover from a security attack.
Types:
1. Encipherment: Symmetric Cypher Model / Asymmetric Cypher Model
2. Digital Signature
3. Access Control

### Security Services: 
A service that enhances security of the data processing system using various security mechanisms. Services provided in X-800:
1. Authentication: Peer Entity, Data Origin
2. Access Control: RBAC (role based), MAC (mandatory), DAC (discretion)
3. Data Confidentiality: Connection, Connectionless, Selective Repeat, Traffic Flow
4. Data Integrity: With Recovery, Without Recovery, SFC, SFCL (Selective Field)
5. Data Repudiation: Non Repudiation Origin and Destination
