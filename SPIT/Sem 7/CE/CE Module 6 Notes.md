##### Scanners 
A Scanner is an input device and is used to input data into the computer system in the form of pictures. It optically scans images, printed text, handwriting, or an object, and converts it to a digital image. Examples of scanners are a desktop or flatbed scanner. In scanners the document is placed on a glass window for scanning. Mechanically driven scanners that move the document are typically used for large-formatted volume of documents. Another type of scanner is a planetary scanner. This scanner takes photographs of books and documents. Three dimensional scanners are used for producing three-dimensional models of objects.


##### Printers
Printers are used for producing output on paper. There are a large variety of printers and printing devices which can be classified according to the print quality and printing speed. These varieties of printers are: 

**Printing Technology: impact printers vs. non impact printers** 
1. **Impact printers** use variations of the standard typewriter printing mechanism where a hammer strikes paper through an inked ribbon. 
2. **Non-impact printers**: A non Impact printer uses chemical, heat or electrical signals to produce symbols on paper. Some of these require special coated or treated paper to print characters on them.

**Classification of printers on the basis of speed:** 
On the basis of speed printers are of following types 
1. **Character Printer:** These printers can print only one character at a time. They work similar to a typewriter. The examples are Daisy Wheel Printer, Dot Matrix Printer and Inkjet Printer.
	1. **Daisy-Wheel Printer:** This printer is similar to a ball-head typewriter. This type of printer has a plastic or metal wheel on which the shape of each character is embossed. A hammer presses the wheel against a ribbon, which in turn makes an ink stain in the shape of the character on the paper. Daisy-wheel printers produce letter- quality print but cannot print graphics. The print quality of this impact printer is very low as is the speed. These are practically obsolete now.
	   
	2. **Dot-Matrix Printer:** This is one of the most popular printers used for personal computing systems. These printers are relatively cheaper compared to other technologies and use impact technology. A Dot-Matrix printer creates characters by striking pins against an ink soaked ribbon. Each pin makes a dot and combinations of dots form characters and illustrations. The moving portion of the printer is called the print head.
	   
2. **Line Printer:** As the name suggests a line printer is a high speed printer which is used to print one entire line of text at a time. Line printers are used to print large amount of data, printing labels, accounting work and other large business printing applications in data centers. These are fast printers ranging in speed from 300 to 2500 lines per minute. Examples are Drum Printers and Chain Printers.
   
3. **Page Printer:** These are very high speed printers which produce high quality output. Their speed ranges from10-25 pages per minute. These printers are commonly used today. They use modern Laser Printer technology and print a whole page at one go. There are many varieties of laser page printers and so their prices range from base level upwards.

**Classification of printers on the basis of quality:** 
The various types of printers based on print quality are as follows 
1. **Ink-jet Printer:** The Inkjet printer works on inkjet technology and produces better quality printouts than dot matrix printers. These print by spraying a controlled stream of tiny ink droplets accurately on the paper forming either dot matrix or solid characters. The printing quality of these printers is very good with a speed of 700 or more characters per second. These are non-impact and hence are relatively silent during the printing process. These printers are easy to use and can be used to print color pages.
   
2. **Laser Printer:** This is a high quality, high speed and high volume technology printer. In laser printers, a laser beam is used to produce an image on a drum. The light of the laser alters the electrical charge on the drum wherever it hits it. The drum is then rolled through a reservoir of toner, which is picked up by the charged portions of the drum. Finally, the toner is transferred to the paper through a combination of heat and pressure. Laser printers produce very high quality text and graphics but are expensive. The technology used by them is the same as that of photocopying machines. The speed of laser printers varies from 10 pages per minute to 200 pages per minute. Laser printers are also called page printers; because they print a whole page at one go. Standard laser printers can be classified into two categories in terms of color: 
	- **Monochrome laser printer**: Monochrome laser printers use a single toner. They are 5 times cheaper than color laser printers.
	  
	- **Color laser printer**: Color laser printers use four toners to print in full color. Color laser printers are popular and are being widely used, in spite of their cost. To print documents with graphics and photographs a color laser printer is a good option. Print speed, quality, printer resolution, reliability and the costs of toner are the major deciding factors for choosing a printer.


##### Projection Displays
These are normally used for large group presentations. These systems can be connected to a computer and whatever appears on the computer terminal gets enlarged and projected on a large screen. Video projector receives video signals and projects the corresponding image on a projection screen. It uses a lens system for this projection.

**Classification of monitors on the basis of color** 
In terms of color capabilities, monitors can be divided into the following groups: 
1. **Monochrome:** These monitors display the result in two colors, i.e., black/white, green/black, amber/black. One color is for the background of the screen and other for the foreground. 
2. **Gray Scale:** It is a monochrome type of monitor. But it displays the output by using different shades of gray, made by a combination of black and white. 
3. **Color Monitor:** It can display the output in many colors, ranging from 16 to over 1 million different colors. These are also called as RGB monitors, because they accept three separate signals, which are red, green, and blue. 

**Classification of monitors on the basis of size** 
After color classification, the most important aspect of a monitor is its screen size. The Size of computer screen is measured in diagonal inches and is given by measuring the distance from one corner to the opposite corner (diagonally). The smallest size for VGA monitors is 14 inches, which is also the entry level monitor for most computer systems. The Larger size landscape monitors can display two full pages side by side at a time. Other typical monitor sizes are 17 inches, 20 inches, 23 inches etc. 

**Classification of monitors on the basis of Resolution** 
The resolution of a monitor means the number of pixels per inch appearing on its surface. In general the greater the number of pixels the sharper is the images. Most modern monitors can display 1024 by 768 pixels. Some high-end models of computer monitors can display 1280 by 1024, or even 1600 by 1200 pixels. Even 3280 by 2048 resolution monitors are available for special purposes. While CRTs provide variability in resolution LCDs monitor have a fixed resolution.

Classification of monitors on the basis of signal Computer monitor can be divided into two categories on the basis of the type of signal which they accept. These are: 
1. **Analog Monitor**: The Electronic signal that is sent by signals of varying frequency, amplitude or phase instead of being sent as an ON or OFF data transmission is called an analog signal. Analog signals allow equipment to handle information that continuously changes such as voltage, current, etc. These are the traditional type of color monitors and are based on CRT technology. These work like the television screen and accept analog signals.
   
2. **Digital Monitor**: An electronic signal that is sent as binary digits of either ON or OFF is called a Digital signal. As shown in Figure 4.22 examples of digital signals and how they look like. In the first diagram signals are either 0 or 1 i.e. up or down for ON and OFF mode. In the right digital pictures are shown where a pixel is either ON or OFF helping to create an image on the display screen. The digital monitor receives digital signals and can use CRT technology. The data in these monitors is received from the video adapter. These are of different types such as CGA (Color Graphics Adapter), EGA (Enhanced Graphics Adapter), VGA (Video Graphics Array), and SVGA (Super Video Graphics Array). These are fast and produce clear images.
