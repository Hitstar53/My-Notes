#### Q1: Module 1 - Introduction to Recommendation Systems (20 Marks)
a. Design a simple matrix-based recommendation system for a small bookstore dataset (5 users and 5 books). Perform matrix factorization on the given user-item interaction matrix and predict the rating for a specific user-book pair. (Hint: Assume dummy ratings if needed). **(10 marks)**

b. Explain the issues in recommendation systems regarding fairness, diversity, and novelty. Suggest practical methods to address these issues. **(10 marks)**

#### Q2: Module 2 - Collaborative Filtering (20 Marks)
a. A startup is planning to implement a collaborative filtering-based recommendation system for an e-commerce website. Outline the key steps involved in designing such a system, considering data collection, preprocessing, and evaluation. **(8 marks)**

b. Assume the following rating matrix for a movie recommendation system:

|Movie 1|Movie 2|Movie 3|Movie 4|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|U1|4|?|2|5|
|U2|5|4|?|4|
|U3|3|?|4|?|
Use user-based collaborative filtering (with Pearson correlation as similarity metric) to predict the missing ratings marked as `?`. **(12 marks)**

#### Q3: Module 3 - Content-Based Recommendation (20 Marks)
a. Design a content-based recommendation system for recommending movies. Describe the steps for extracting features, creating profiles, and predicting movie preferences for a new user. Provide a high-level architecture. **(10 marks)**

b. A company wants to recommend articles to users based on their reading history. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using content-based filtering in this scenario. **(5 marks)**

c. Suggest a classification algorithm that could enhance a content-based recommendation system. Provide reasons for your choice and an example of how it could be applied. **(5 marks)**

---
#### Q4: Module 4 - Knowledge-Based & Hybrid Approaches (20 Marks)
a. A travel company wants to recommend holiday packages to its customers. Suggest how a constraint-based knowledge recommendation system could be designed for this use case. Provide an example. **(10 marks)**

b. Discuss the following hybridization strategies with examples:
- Switching
- Pipelined
- Feature combination **(10 marks)**
---
#### Q5: Module 5 - Context-Aware & Constraint-Based RS (20 Marks)
a. Assume you are building a context-aware recommendation system for a food delivery app. Explain how you would use contextual features like time, location, and user preferences to personalize recommendations. **(10 marks)**

b. Describe the steps to design and implement a constraint-based recommender system for a real estate platform. Highlight how constraints like budget, location, and amenities can be handled. **(10 marks)**
