Gamification is the craft of deriving all the fun and engaging elements found in games and applying them to real-world or productive activities. This process is what I call “Human-Focused Design,” as opposed to “Function-Focused Design.” It’s a design process that optimizes human motivation in a system, as opposed to pure efficiency.

# The Octalysis Framework for Gamification & Behavioral Design
It consists of 8 core drives of Gamification:
1. Epic Meaning & Calling
	Epic Meaning & Calling is the Core Drive where a player believes that he is doing something greater than himself or he was “chosen” to do something. A symptom of this is a player that devotes a lot of his time to maintaining a forum or helping to create things for the entire community (think Wikipedia or Open Source projects). This also comes into play when someone has “Beginner’s Luck” – an effect where people believe they have some type of gift that others don’t or believe they were “lucky” to get that amazing sword at the very beginning of the game.
2. Development & Accomplishment
	 Development & Accomplishment is the internal drive of making progress, developing skills, and eventually overcoming challenges. The word “challenge” here is very important, as a badge or trophy without a challenge is not meaningful at all. This is also the Core Drive that is the easiest to design for and coincidently is where most of the PBLs: points, badges, and leaderboards mostly focus on.
3. Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback
	Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback is when users are engaged in a creative process where they have to repeatedly figure things out and try different combinations. People not only need ways to express their creativity, but they need to be able to see the results of their creativity, receive feedback, and respond in turn. This is why playing with Legos and painting are fun in-and-of themselves and often become Evergreen Mechanics, where a game designer no longer needs to continuously add more content to keep the activity fresh and engaging.
4. Ownership & Possession
	This is the drive where users are motivated because they feel like they own something. When a player feels ownership, she innately wants to make what she owns better and own even more. Besides being the major Core Drive for wanting to accumulate wealth, this deals with many virtual goods or virtual currencies within systems. Also, if a person spends a lot of time customizing her profile or her [avatar](https://yukaichou.com/advanced-gamification/the-avatar-gamification-design-technique/), she automatically feels more ownership towards it too. Finally, this is also the Core Drive that makes collecting stamps or puzzle pieces fun.
5. Social Influence & Relatedness
	This drive incorporates all the social elements that drive people, including mentorship, acceptance, social responses, companionship, as well as competition and envy. When you see a friend that is amazing at some skill or owns something extraordinary, you become driven to reach the same level. Also, it includes the drive we have to draw closer to people, places, or events that we can relate to. If you see a product that reminds you of your childhood, the sense of nostalgia would likely increase the odds of you buying the product. This Core Drive is relatively well-studied too, as many companies these days are putting a lot of priority on optimizing their online social strategies.
6. Scarcity & Impatience
	This is the drive of wanting something because you can’t have it. Many games have Appointment Dynamics (come back 2 hours later to get your reward) – the fact that people can’t get something right now motivates them to think about it all day long. This is the Core Drive utilized by Facebook when it first started: at first it was just for Harvard. Then it opened up to a few other prestigious schools, and eventually all colleges. When it finally opened up to everyone, many people wanted to join because they previously couldn’t get into it.
7. Unpredictability & Curiosity
	Generally, this is a harmless drive of wanting to find out what will happen next. If you don’t know what’s going to happen, your brain is engaged and you think about it often. Many people watch movies or read novels because of this drive. However, this drive is also the primary factor behind gambling addiction. Also, this Core Drive is utilized whenever a company runs a sweepstake or lottery program to engage users. The very controversial Skinner Box experiments, where an animal irrationally presses a lever frequently because of unpredictable results, are exclusively referring to the Core Drive of Unpredictability & Curiosity, although many have misunderstood it as the driver behind points, badges, and leaderboard mechanics in general.
8. Loss & Avoidance
	This Core Drive is based upon the avoidance of something negative happening. On a small scale, it could be to avoid losing previous work. On a larger scale, it could be to avoid admitting that everything you did up to this point was useless because you are now quitting. Also, opportunities that are fading away have a strong utilization of this Core Drive, because people feel like if they didn’t act immediately, they would lose the opportunity to act forever.

# Examples of Gamification in Banking:
1. Saving Goals
	Goal setting is a valuable feature for users to stay on track with their savings and progress. Imagine you decide to save up for a dream vacation in Hawaii and use an old-school piggy bank. You just throw money in it with no plan or progress tracking. How long will it take you to reach the goal? God knows. Virtual piggy banks can be much more effective for users. Setting up a goal can help them break the process down into smaller pieces of the puzzle. For example, track how much money is already in the money box or how much they need to save weekly or monthly.
	**Tinkoff** users who open a savings account, can set a goal and a deadline to keep an eye on the process. The app will display how much a user needs to top up every month to achieve the objective and keep the motivation up.
2. Budgeting
	One of the most popular gamified features of budget management apps is expense tracking. Usually, it includes elements like visualized spending transactions, colorful category grids, dashboards, and a percentage tracker.
	**Oops’s** mission is to “help you not waste your money.” Users can link a card to the app, immediately see past transactions, and swipe left-right to sort transactions into categories represented with emojis.
3. Cashback & Rewards
	To boost customer loyalty, gamification in the banking sector leans on cash back, a system of monetary rewards in which a user gets back a small amount of the total price paid. Usually, banks collaborate with retailers and companies to create such incentives.
	**Revolut** offers users a 3% cashback on online purchases from more than a thousand brands and retailers. Unlike other shops and cards, there is no need to wait for weeks for cash rewards. It gets applied instantly in the app.
4. Achievement Badges
	How to make banking transactions and tasks enjoyable? Introduce the achievement-based system. For example, give away badges to users for spending on certain categories, using the card abroad, or splitting bills with friends. Unlocking achievement badges can help maintain the motivation of users and achieve a high retention rate.
	**Monobank** is one of the gamification champions in the FinTech sector. In 2019, the bank launched an achievement program for users to complete simple tasks and earn up to 51 badges. Tasks included completing your personal profile or using ApplePay for a transaction. The first users to collect all badges got exclusive prizes and perks from the company.
