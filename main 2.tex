\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    Our project aims to develop a versatile medical chatbot that addresses healthcare concerns through multiple modalities. Users can input their symptoms in Hinglish, which the chatbot intelligently converts to English while extracting relevant medical terms for analysis. Leveraging named entity recognition (NER), the chatbot predicts probable diseases based on the extracted symptoms and recommends appropriate doctor consultations. Additionally, the chatbot integrates image processing algorithms for analyzing medical image scans, particularly for diseases like cancer. By offering multimodal diagnosis capabilities and targeting non-critical diseases, our project seeks to enhance healthcare accessibility and outcomes for diverse populations, including non-native English speakers and those requiring image-based diagnoses.

\section{Introduction}
The healthcare industry is constantly evolving with technological advancements, yet accessing accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations remains a challenge for many individuals.

Traditional healthcare systems often require patients to visit medical facilities in person, leading to long waiting times and geographical constraints. Moreover, language barriers can further impede effective communication between patients and healthcare professionals. Our AI-powered system, seeks to address these challenges by providing a convenient and accessible platform for users to describe their symptoms, receive accurate diagnoses, and access personalized treatment recommendations, all from the comfort of their own homes.

By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and image processing, this project aims to streamline the diagnostic process and improve healthcare outcomes for patients worldwide. Through this project, we envision empowering individuals to take control of their health, regardless of their location or linguistic background.

\section{Problem Definition, Scope \& Objectives of the Project}
\subsection{Problem Definition}
In the realm of healthcare, effective communication between patients and healthcare providers is essential for accurate diagnosis and timely treatment. However, language barriers and the complexity of medical terminology often hinder this communication, especially for non-native English speakers. Additionally, accessing healthcare services and obtaining accurate medical advice can be challenging for individuals residing in remote or underserved areas. To address these challenges, our project aims to develop a medical chatbot that facilitates communication between users and healthcare services, particularly focusing on the Hinglish-speaking population. This chatbot will enable users to describe their symptoms comfortably in Hinglish and receive accurate medical advice and predictions, thereby overcoming language barriers and improving healthcare accessibility for a broader audience.

\subsection{Scope}
Our project will provide a list of 3 to 5 probable diagnoses for non-critical diseases based on symptom analysis, where users must further consult a doctor for confirmation. It will not cover the provision of final diagnoses for medical conditions. Additionally, the language translation component will focus solely on Hinglish to English medical keyword extraction for symptom analysis, rather than providing comprehensive translation services. Furthermore, the image scan analysis will be limited to cancer-related predictions and will not encompass diagnoses for other medical conditions.

\subsection{Objectives}
The objectives of our project are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Develop a medical chatbot that accepts symptom descriptions in Hinglish and intelligently extracts relevant medical terms for analysis.
\item Utilize named entity recognition (NER) to predict probable diseases based on the extracted symptoms and recommend appropriate doctor consultations.
\item Integrate image processing algorithms for analyzing medical image scans, particularly for diseases like cancer, to enhance diagnostic accuracy.
\item Provide a versatile and accessible platform for users to receive accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment recommendations, regardless of their linguistic background or geographical location.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Literature Survey}
In our literature survey, we conducted a detailed study of existing research papers and relevant literature pertaining to AI-powered diagnosis systems, virtual consultations, and multimodal analysis in healthcare. The following is a summary of the key findings from our review:

AI-Powered Diagnosis Systems:

Numerous studies have explored the application of artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning algorithms, in healthcare diagnosis. These systems utilize patient data, including symptoms, medical history, and diagnostic tests, to predict and identify potential medical conditions.
Research has shown promising results in terms of the accuracy and efficiency of AI-powered diagnosis systems compared to traditional methods. These systems have demonstrated the ability to assist healthcare professionals in making more accurate and timely diagnoses, thereby improving patient outcomes.
Virtual Consultations:

Virtual consultations have gained traction in recent years as a convenient and accessible means of delivering healthcare services. These consultations allow patients to connect with healthcare professionals remotely via video calls, eliminating the need for physical visits to medical facilities.
Studies have highlighted the benefits of virtual consultations, including reduced wait times, increased convenience for patients, and improved access to specialist care, particularly in rural or underserved areas.
Multimodal Analysis in Healthcare:

Multimodal analysis involves the integration of multiple types of data, such as text, images, and audio, to extract meaningful insights in healthcare settings. This approach enables a more comprehensive assessment of patient health and facilitates more accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations.
Research in multimodal analysis has focused on various applications, including medical image analysis, speech recognition, and sensor data fusion. These studies have demonstrated the potential for multimodal analysis to enhance diagnostic accuracy and improve patient care.
Overall, our literature survey highlights the growing interest and investment in AI-driven technologies for healthcare diagnosis and treatment. By leveraging these advancements, our project aims to contribute to the development of an innovative and effective solution for improving healthcare accessibility and outcomes.
