Most Common HR Interview Questions [here](https://www.indiabix.com/hr-interview/questions-and-answers/)
## Introduction:
Hello, I am Hatim Sawai, born and brought up in Mumbai. I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in computer engineering at SPIT. I like building tech that solves some real world problems. 

Last year i had worked as a software developer intern and helped build a unified portal application for my college. I gained lots of experience in web development from my internship. My most recent projects include Nyay which is an online platform created to digitize the whole legal process. I am well versed with python, java and c and web frameworks like react, next, node, express, Django and flask.

In the past academic year I lead web development initiatives while being the technical head at Google Developer Student Clubs of my college. I love the energy of working with a team to create something new. 

I am currently looking for opportunities in the software industry. If there’s any area apart from my expertise that you would like me to expand in.. I’ll be happy to do so.

## Strengths
Overtime I have developed many strengths throughout my degree, some of them are being an active team player, I am a good listener, I always make sure to listen to both sides of a story. I am also a bit of a perfectionist and like to do things with highest level of quality.

## Weaknesses
One area I'm continuously working to improve is my public speaking skills. As someone who's naturally more introverted, I used to find it challenging to present my ideas to large groups. However, I've recognized the importance of this skill in the tech industry, especially when it comes to sharing project updates or pitching ideas.

To address this, I've been actively seeking opportunities to practice. I volunteered to lead more presentations in my university projects and joined the Google Developer Student Club, where I've had chances to speak and host events, this has boosted my confidence a lot.

## Where do I see myself in 5 years
I do not know what the future has in store for me, but I want to become financially independent, able to provide for my family and keep learning new things about my field, especially AI which I am passionate about.

## Why I want to Work Here?
Answer will be company specific, some general stuff can be mentioned like: Spoken to seniors who work here and they said the work culture is very good, I see a potential for growth while working at the company in areas of my interest, as well as in other fields.
