4. A tattoo-like plastic patch that can monitor vital signs.
5. A smart contact lens or skin patch sensor that analyzes sweat, to monitor the user’s blood sugar levels.
6. A wearable that will help patients with Parkinson’s disease by providing deep brain stimulation, a common method of treatment typically requiring heavy physician involvement.


#### Module 5.2: Fitness Devices: Blood Pressure
Fitness devices are electronic tools designed to help individuals monitor and improve their physical health and fitness. These devices combine sensors, data processing, and connectivity to track vital health metrics such as blood pressure, weight, glucose levels, and physical activity.

**Blood pressure** is defined as the force exerted by the blood against the walls of the blood vessels and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) above atmospheric pressure. Arterial blood pressure is the lateral pressure (or force exerted by the blood on a unit area) on the arterial wall and this pressure constantly changes over the course of the cardiac cycle.

Though measuring BP is a continuous process, it is common practice to measure the highest pressure and the lowest pressure in this cycle. The highest pressure is the systolic blood pressure which is produced by contraction of the heart, the lowest pressure is the diastolic blood pressure which is the pressure between heart beats. A typical or normal BP is expressed as **120/80 mm Hg**, where **120 is the systolic** pressure and **80 is the diastolic** pressure.

##### Measurement of Blood Pressure
Blood Pressure can be measured in 2 ways:
1. Direct Measurements
2. Indirect Measurements


#### Module 5.3: Biomedical Devices: ECG
An electrocardiogram or ECG, records electrical activity in the heart. An ECG machine records these electrical signals across multiple heart beats and produces an ECG strip

##### ECG Waveform Components
It is waveform components that consist of the electrical events during one heartbeat. The waveforms are labeled as P, Q, R, S, T and U:
![[Pasted image 20241210123238.png]]
1. **P wave:** It is the first short upward movement of the ECG tracing. It indicates that the atria are contracting, pumping blood into the ventricles. 
	- Amplitude: 2-3 mm high The P-wave should be 2–3 small squares in duration
	- Duration: 0.06 - 0.12 sec.
2. **PR interval:** The PR interval indicates the transit time for the electrical signal to travel from the sinus node to the ventricles.
	- Amplitude: The PR interval should be 3–5 squares in duration. 
	- Duration: 0.012 - 0.20 sec.
3. **QRS complex:** The QRS complex, normally beginning with a downward deflection, Q; a larger upwards deflection, a peak (R); and then a downwards S wave. The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization and contraction. 
	- Amplitude: 5-30 mm high The QRS complex should be 1.5–2.5 small squares in duration 
	- Duration: 0.06 - 0.10 sec
4. **QT interval:** This interval spans the onset of depolarization to the completion of repolarization of the ventricles. 
	- Amplitude: The QT interval should be 9–11 small squares.
5. **ST Segment**: isoelectric - part of repolarization.
6. **T wave:** T wave is normally a modest upwards waveform representing ventricular repolarization. 
	- Amplitude: 0.5 mm in limb leads.
	- Duration: 0.1 - 0.25 sec
