## How do you approach a SQL interview question?
SQL interviews are stressful, but if you approach each question with a structured approach, you’ll ace the SQL interview. Here’s the 6 steps to solve any SQL interview question:
1. Understand the question
2. Identify Relevant information
3. Break down the problem
4. Consider Edge Cases
5. Write queries to answer sub-problems
6. Test your final query
#### Step 1: Understand the Question
Often you might get a long SQL word problem, where you’ll have lots of extra details and it might not be clear what the interviewer is specifically asking you to query. So understanding and clarifying what specifically needs to be done is the best first step to take.
#### Step 2: Identify Relevant information
You might have extraneous columns, or even extra tables that aren’t needed for your SQL query. Interviewers do this on purpose, because in real-world SQL you'll often have thousands of tables, with hundreds of columns, and it's a skill to determine what information you actually need to query that's relevant to the problem. As such, Identify what’s actually needed to directly answer the SQL interview question at-hand.
#### Step 3: Break Down the Problem
Often, SQL interviews have a multi-part solution, consisting of multiple joins, unions, subqueries, and CTEs. Map out what are the smaller building blocks that are needed for the final solution. You want to verbalize this step, because it shows the interviewer that's watching you code that you are able to break-down complex problems into simpler sub-problems – a useful skill not just in SQL, but in Data Analytics & Data Science as a whole.
#### Step 4: Consider Edge Cases
You can’t forget edge cases, like if some value is null, or there is a tie in your results set. Make sure to think about this BEFORE you start writing your SQL query. Frequently, SQL interviews will purposely have tricky test cases which catch whether you’ve handled all edge cases.
#### Step 5: Write Queries for Sub-Problems
Write queries to answer sub-problems: don’t go after the question all at once. Write small subqueries that answer sub-problems. Test your solutions incrementally, and slowly combine your sub-problem results. If you try to answer the problem all in one go, your SQL query likely won’t run and you’ll overwhelm yourself trying to figure which of the 27 lines you wrote contains the error.
#### Step 6: Test Your Final Query
Run your SQL query, and validate that your output matches the expected output. From coaching hundreds of people, you won’t believe how many people _think_ they have the final solution, but don’t realize there’s a slight difference between the expected results and what they produced.


## How do you Optimize SQL Queries?
#### SQL query optimization best practices:
- [**Use indexes effectively**](https://www.thoughtspot.com/data-trends/data-modeling/optimizing-sql-queries#sql1)
- [**Avoid SELECT * and retrieve only necessary columns**](https://www.thoughtspot.com/data-trends/data-modeling/optimizing-sql-queries#sql2)
- [**Optimize JOIN operations**](https://www.thoughtspot.com/data-trends/data-modeling/optimizing-sql-queries#sql3)
- [**Minimize the use of subqueries**](https://www.thoughtspot.com/data-trends/data-modeling/optimizing-sql-queries#sql4)
