## Technologies Used in the Course:
The course is generally language-agnostic but here are some things that are essentials:
1. Basics of Python & R
2. Basics of Tableau & Power Bi

## Primary Types of data:
1. Continuous Data: Numerical data that can take any value within a range (e.g., temp)
2. Discrete Data: Numerical data with distinct, separate values (e.g., Age of students)
3. Nominal Data: Categorical data without any inherent order (e.g., colors, blood types)
4. Ordinal Data: Categorical data with a meaningful order or ranking (e.g. ratings)

Other types of data: Binary (case of nominal with 2 categories), Interval & Ratio Data

## Data Visualization According to Types:
### 1. Distribution plots
1. **Histogram**: frequency on y-axis and numeric data converted to ranges on x-axis, it works with numeric discretized continuous data (interval data), conversion is called binning, and ranges are called bins. It also tells us a central tendency of the data, and dispersion/spread of the data:
	1. Mean: Avg. of all data val. in a dataset, best suited for continuous / interval data
	2. Median: Mid val. of a sorted dataset, best suited for ordinal data.
	3. Mode: The most frequently occurring value(s) in a dataset, best suited for nominal data. Data can be Uni-modal (1 mode), multi-modal (more than 1 mode) or non-modal (all categories of equal frequency).
### 2. Categorical plots
### 3. Relational plots
