## Opening for the GD:
Good Morning All, as we gather to discuss India's ascension to the rank of the world's fifth-largest economy, we find ourselves at a pivotal moment in global economic history. This achievement, marked by India surpassing the United Kingdom in 2022, is not merely a statistic, but a testament to the nation's resilience, potential, and the culmination of decades of economic liberalization and reform.

With a GDP of approximately $3.9 trillion, India's economic narrative is one of contrasts and opportunities. On one hand, we have a burgeoning tech sector, a demographic dividend with a median age of 28 years, and a rapidly digitalizing economy. On the other, we face challenges of income inequality, infrastructure development, and the imperative to create millions of jobs annually.

As we delve deeper into this topic, I propose we explore not just the factors that have propelled India to this position, but also the responsibilities and challenges that come with it. How can India leverage this economic stature to address its socio-economic disparities? What strategic moves are necessary to further climb the economic ladder while ensuring inclusive growth?

Moreover, in an era of shifting global dynamics, how does India's rise impact the international economic order, particularly in relation to other emerging economies and the Global South?

These are the questions I believe we must grapple with as we discuss India's position as the world's fifth-largest economy. ==I look forward to a robust and insightful exchange of ideas with all of you. ==


## Important Points During The GD:
Intro - Basic Facts:
1. (Past) India became the 5th largest economy in the world, after surpassing the UK in 2022. We have been the fastest-growing nation with annual growth between 6% to 7% in the last decade. In 2016, we were at 8.2% in growth.
2. (Present) Today India's GDP is around $3.937 trillion and is expected to grow at a rate of 6.4%.
3. (Future) In fact, India is projected to overtake Japan and Germany to become the world’s third-largest economy around 2030 and the US by the year 2048, when it will become the world’s second-largest economy behind China.

JPMC Bond Index Inclusion:
1. (Present) Indian government bonds have been included in the renowned JP Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index on 28th June, 2024. This is a significant achievement for the Indian financial market. It indicates the rapid growth of India’s economy and assures foreign investors of the strength and reliability of India’s debt market.
2. (Effect) Over the past nine months, since September 2023, foreign investors have invested approximately $10 billion in the Indian bond market.
3. (Effect) Companies will be able to borrow at lower interest rates, making it easier for them to expand their businesses and boost the economy.
4. (Future) Other global indices like Bloomberg and FTSE may also consider including Indian bonds in their portfolios. This could lead to even more foreign investment in India.

General Facts:
1. (Counter) India’s $3.3 trillion economy is created by its vast population of 1.3 billion. This means that the output of the average person (or per-capita GDP) is a low $2,500 per person. In comparison, the average Chinese person has the economic output of about $16,000.
2. (Counter) While India is a large economy on an absolute basis, it must continue to grow like it has been growing for a long time to lift the fortunes of its vast population.
3. Having a lower trade deficit offers several advantages to a country. It promotes economic stability by reducing reliance on foreign borrowing for imports, which in turn can stabilize the overall economy. 
4. In the fourth quarter of FY24, India's merchandise **trade deficit** shrank to its lowest in 11 quarters, standing at 5.4 per cent of GDP. This improvement was driven by a rise in merchandise exports, reaching a five-quarter high of 12.9 per cent, coupled with a decrease in merchandise imports to an 11-quarter low of 18.3 per cent of GDP.
5. **Manufacturing and services** remain two key contributors to India's economy. Post Covid-19, just as global companies were looking to shift their manufacturing units from China in an attempt to diversify options, India has emerged as a robust alternative. The Modi government has deployed schemes like the Production-linked Incentive (PLI) to invite global companies to manufacture in India, across a host of sectors.
6. Unemployment Rate stands ate approx. 8% in 2024, which has risen.
7. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) **works to achieve sustainable growth and prosperity for all of its 190 member countries**. It does so by supporting economic policies that promote financial stability and monetary cooperation, which are essential to increase productivity, job creation, and economic well-being.
8. The global economy is struggling to maintain its recovery post-Covid because successive shocks have buffeted it like the Russia Ukraine war, the middle east conflict, etc. Some of them, such as supply chain disruptions, have returned in 2024. If they persist, they will impact trade flows, transportation costs, economic output and inflation worldwide.
9. Despite economic growth, income inequality remains a significant issue, with the top 10% of the population holding a majority of the wealth.
10. A strong logistics framework will be key in transforming India from a services-dominated economy into a manufacturing-dominant one.
