### Shortlisting / Resume:
1. CGPA - 8.5+ is safe
2. Resume - ATS compliant, single page, no colours, Sample link : [Jake’s Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume-anonymous/cstpnrbkhndn)
3. Don’t believe in online Resume Checkers, believe in yourself :)
4. Basic Outline for a Resume:
	1. **Name**: Give all social links below (github, mail, linkedin, leetcode (if profile is decent))
	2. **Education:** Mention minors (if any) as a separate entry. If you have enough projects, 2 separate educational certifications is enough, else go for 3
	3. **Coursework:**  Not very very important, but acts as a good filler, put in names of important courses (DSA, DBMS, CAO for Comps, AIML, DS and LA, CAO, Network Theory for EXTC peeps)
	4. **Work Exp:**  3 bullet points (max 4) describing the module you worked on, what was your contribution and impact it made. Use metrics at least in one of the points(e.g. reduced loading time by 25%, increased efficiency by 40%, etc.)
	5. **Projects:**  Similar pattern as Work Exp. Here don't mention that you worked on only a specific part, also Projects and Work Experience should be in decreasing Chronological Order. Try to have 4 separate things (Work Exp + Projects both combined) and should cover almost 50% of the page. Add links (vercel links if projects are deployed else github links in the title of the project)
	6. **Achievements:**  Include Hackathons, Tech Competitions at first priority, can include district level championships in any sports, cultural activities, etc.
	7. **Skills:**  Mention only those tech stacks and softwares that you know, interviewer might ask you questions based on it
	8. **Leadership:**  Committee Positions, volunteer work all are welcome here. No need to elaborate on your work here, especially since the above stuff should leave you with just enough space so that only names and positions can be added.
	9. For Summers, roles are mostly all SDEs only, so no need for modifications, but in future, modify the resumes as per the roles.

3. Always take a pause and understand if the interviewer is keeping pace with you
4. Try hard, think out loud, ask for hints if you’re stuck.
5. If you need a minute to think/frame an answer, ask the interviewer for the same.
6. DO NOT LIE
7. Stay confident. A partially correct answer with 100% confidence >>>> Fully correct answer with 50% confidence.
8. Keep questions ready for the interviewer, they always ask if you have any questions for them. **Never say no here.**
9. Common Questions (if you can't think of anything to ask):
10. How is the work culture at the company?
11. What are some things that I would get to work on if I get selected?
12. How is the interview experience for you overall, sitting on the opposite side and is there anything that I could have done differently in today’s interview?
13. Keep the answer to ‘introduce yourself’ ready. General Flow: Name -> Current Education (include Minors) -> Describe your tech enthu (1 line) -> delve into projects -> dive into your leadership positions -> End with something along the lines of “excited for today's interview”.
